For my final project I would like to apply the skills that I have/will learn in this course to make an interactive web map for a project that I am working on with the OSU Extension, Rural Communities Explorer (RCE) team called Oregon by the Numbers (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.. We are working on the second edition and are currently collecting data to update the measures provided in the report. I believe a web map version of this report can help increase the usability, visibility, and availability Oregon by the Numbers.

Some ideas I have for this project is to create a platform where you can choose measures and a choropleth will result show up by counties in Oregon. Within these measures if possible when clicking on a specific county, a time series graph appears to show how that specific county measures over time. Iâ€™m still working out details of how this may be implemented and will have a better idea of final deliverable possibly after learning more about story maps.
